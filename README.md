Novel Reader

Reading novels is a common hobby for a lot of people, one that is done a lot on mobile devices. The most common form of reading a novel offline uses an .epub file reader, but most reader applications can only read downloaded files.
With this app I want to allow for users to read novels from existing local saves but also to allow for progress saves, like bookmarking.
